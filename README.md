# 🎮 Capture Olin

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of **Capture Olin** was to create a fun, well-scoped, and impressive two-player strategy game that would challenge us as developers without demanding an unreasonable workload. We aimed to produce something both technically sound and visually engaging — a game that not only worked well but was actually enjoyable to play and easy to demonstrate.

Our project draws inspiration from classic “capture the flag” mechanics, but the true centerpiece is player-player interaction. We also used iMessage's "Penguin Game" as an inspiration. We prioritized strategy and calculated moves over randomness and luck.
